Place the "skript.jar" and "skquery.jar" into your plugins folder and restart your server.
After restarting the server, a Skript folder will load. 
Go into "Skript" > "scripts". Once in "scripts" folder, place the "axr.sk" into "scripts" folder.
Go in game and type "/sk reload axr"
Enjoy!

WANT FAKE ORES?
You need Paper Spigot for that: 

1) Get paper or (paperspigot) from either (https://serverjars.com/) or (https://papermc.io/downloads)
2) Swap the paper.jar with your current spigot.jar *(make sure it's the same version you are running)* 
3) Start up the new paper server
4) Upload the "paper.yml" and replace it with default generated one in server's root files. save --> restart.
